            <h3>Cybersecurity Mock Audit</h3>
            <p>In my Cybersecurity Mock Audit project for Mosse Cybersecurity Institute, I assessed the security posture of a simulated organization, identifying vulnerabilities in their network, systems, and applications. I then developed a comprehensive report with recommendations for remediation, demonstrating my ability to apply critical thinking and problem-solving skills to real-world cybersecurity challenges.</p>

            <h3>Finger Printing Authentication</h3>
            <p>It was a fun challenge building this, and I learned a lot about coding and security. Now, I want to share this cool project with the world! Maybe you can use it on your phone or even inspire you to build your own awesome tech creation.</p>
        
            <p>So, next time someone asks "what have you been up to?", you can confidently say "oh, just built a fingerprint unlocker for my phone!"</p>
